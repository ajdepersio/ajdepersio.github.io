# Summary

I am Andrew DePersio, a software engineer with a passion for quality and producing an unmatched user experience.
My personal belief in the importance of software can be summed up in the following: the ability to further
mankind's endeavors has only ever been limited by the resources available at the time. The role of software
engineers today is to create the resources that act as the catalyst to allow the world to move forward.
<!-- Something about how I've worked in a variety of platforms and industry in many roles -->

# Education

## College/Formal

<!-- Started programming self-taught, TI-83 calculator, modding game consoles and MP3 players introduced me to lots of things (editing configs, reading logs, troubleshooting etc)  -->
<!-- Decided to study Computer Science because I had seen all the cool things that could be done through software and I wanted to be a part of it.  I chose BSU because of emphasis on immersive learning which I would later put into practice.  -->
<!-- Always had a love for Physics and decided to minor in Applied Physics/Nanoscience.  The freaking giant SDS and CVDS Electron microscope, working with Dr. Cancio. -->
<!-- Third love of music.  Marching band + Basketball band.  Met wife through it -->

## Informal

<!-- Multiple online courses/MOOCs (.NET, Node.js, React.js, AWS, Azure).  AWS certification as a part of company push to move to the cloud -->
