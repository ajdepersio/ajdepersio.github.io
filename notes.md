# Notes

## Summary

I am Andrew DePersio, a software engineer with a passion for quality and producing an unmatched user experience.
My personal belief in the importance of software can be summed up in the following: the ability to further
mankind's endeavors has only ever been limited by the resources available at the time. The role of software
engineers today is to create the resources that act as the catalyst to allow the world to move forward.

## Education

### College/Formal

<!-- Started programming self-taught, TI-83 calculator, modding game consoles and MP3 players introduced me to lots of things (editing configs, reading logs, troubleshooting etc)  -->
<!-- Decided to study Computer Science because I had seen all the cool things that could be done through software and I wanted to be a part of it.  I chose BSU because of emphasis on immersive learning which I would later put into practice.  -->
<!-- Always had a love for Physics and decided to minor in Applied Physics/Nanoscience.  The freaking giant SDS and CVDS Electron microscope, working with Dr. Cancio. -->
<!-- Third love of music.  Marching band + Basketball band.  Met wife through it -->

### Informal

<!-- Multiple online courses/MOOCs (.NET, Node.js, React.js, AWS, Azure).  AWS certification as a part of company push to move to the cloud -->

#### Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship

The Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) program encourages undergraduate students to pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers by providing research experiences at the Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories. Selected students participate as interns appointed at one of 17 participating DOE laboratories/facilities. They perform research, under the guidance of laboratory staff scientists or engineers, on projects supporting the DOE mission.

#### Phase Space Dissimilarity Measures for Structural Health Monitoring

A novel method for structural health monitoring (SHM), known as the Phase Space Dissimilarity Measures (PSDM) approach, is proposed and developed. The patented PSDM approach has already been developed and demonstrated for a variety of equipment and biomedical applications. Here, we investigate SHM of bridges via analysis of time serial accelerometer measurements. This work has four aspects. The first is algorithm scalability, which was found to scale linearly from one processing core to four cores. Second, the same data are analyzed to determine how the use of the PSDM approach affects sensor placement. We found that a relatively low-density placement sufficiently captures the dynamics of the structure. Third, the same data are analyzed by unique combinations of accelerometer axes (vertical, longitudinal, and lateral with respect to the bridge) to determine how the choice of axes affects the analysis. The vertical axis is found to provide satisfactory SHM data. Fourth, statistical methods were investigated to validate the PSDM approach for this application, yielding statistically significant results.
